# Neuropathic Pain Diagnosis Simulator

This is a Python project for generating the simulated data in the neuropathic pain diagnosis as shown in [1]. The current version only supports to introduce at most one kind of practical issues per generation.

The directory structure is:

	|- models: the ground-truth causal graph that can be loaded and used for generating simulated data.  
	
	|- result: the simulated data are in this folder.  
	
	|- source: the source codes for computing causal accuracy and generating the simulated data.  
	
	|- exampe: the related files for the demo of computing causal accuracy
	
	run.py: the python file that is used for generating simulated data.  
	
	demo_cauacc.py: a demo shows how [1] computes causal accuracies of PC and FCI outputs in Tetrad [2].  
	
	requirements.txt: all the necessary packages required for the project.  
	
	README.md: Introduction about the project.  

## Installation

Please install all the packages in the "requirements.txt"

## Usage 
### Generating the simulated data
(Please make sure that the current directory is in the project.)

```python run.py -z <sample size: input a integer number> -c <confounder: flag without value> -s <selection bias: flag without value> -m <missing data: flag without value>```

Default setting: sample size 100, no confounder, no selection bias, no missing data 

Example:   
- default setting:   
```python run.py```
  
- sample size 1000, selection bias (the same setting with the paper [1]):   
```python run.py -z 1000 -s```  

- sample size 500, missing data (MCAR):  
```python run.py -z 500 -m```

## Examples

A tutorial shows how to simulate data in the [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/TURuibo/Neuropathic-Pain-Diagnosis-Simulator/blob/master/Tutorial1.ipynb).

A tutorial shows how to compute causal accurcay of PC and FCI on the simulation data [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/TURuibo/Neuropathic-Pain-Diagnosis-Simulator/blob/master/Tutorial2.ipynb.).

## Result: simulated data

The simulated dataset is in the "result" folder. The dataset contains simulated patient diagnostic records.  

Rows of the simulated dataset represent different patients, and columns represent different diagnose (such as left arm pain, C2-C3 discoligamentous injury, and L C2 Radiculopathy).  

'id_name.txt': For the convenience of representation, we denote different names with numbers and the corresponding numbers of names are in this file.
